# Collatz Conjecture & Happy Numbers Project

## 📖 Introduction

This project explores *two famous unsolved problems in mathematics* using a *data science perspective*:

1. *Collatz Conjecture* — a problem based on iterative sequences.
2. *Happy Numbers* — a problem based on digit-sum transformations.

Our goal is to:

* Understand these problems mathematically.
* Generate datasets from them.
* Train machine learning models to detect patterns.
* Evaluate predictive accuracy.
* Provide a framework to extend into deep learning or other advanced methods.

This README serves as a *step-by-step book-style guide*, so anyone (mathematician, data scientist, or beginner) can understand both the theory and the code.

## 🧮 1. The Collatz Conjecture

### *What is the Collatz Conjecture?*

The *Collatz conjecture* is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics, proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937. It defines a sequence based on a starting positive integer n and applies the following rule repeatedly:

### *Collatz Formula:*

### **Collatz Conjecture Formula**

$$
f(n) =
\begin{cases} 
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
3n + 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}
$$

You then repeat this process on the result, forming a sequence.

#### Example: n = 6
- 6 → 3 (even → divide by 2)
- 3 → 10 (odd → 3×3+1)
- 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

The conjecture claims: *Every starting number eventually reaches 1.*

### *Why is it important?*
- It is simple to state but very difficult to prove.
- It demonstrates how deterministic rules can create chaotic behavior.
- It has implications in mathematics, dynamical systems, and computer science.

### *Data Science Objective for Collatz*
We generate datasets with features such as:
- Starting number
- Sequence length (steps to reach 1)
- Maximum value reached
- Even/Odd ratios

We then train ML models to *predict sequence properties* given a number.

## 🔢 2. Happy Numbers

### *What are Happy Numbers?*
A number is called *happy* if repeatedly summing the squares of its digits eventually leads to 1.

### **Happy Number Formula**

If $n$ has digits $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k$:

$$
f(n) = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + \dots + d_k^2
$$

> Repeat $f(n)$ until $n = 1$ (happy) or enters a cycle (unhappy).

#### Example: n = 19
- 1² + 9² = 82
- 8² + 2² = 68
- 6² + 8² = 100
- 1² + 0² + 0² = 1 → *Happy* ✅

If instead it falls into a loop that never reaches 1, it is *unhappy*.

Repeat until result = 1 (happy) or falls into cycle (unhappy).

### *Data Science Objective for Happy Numbers*
We generate datasets with:
- Number
- Iterations taken
- Final outcome (happy/unhappy)
- Cycle length if unhappy

We then train classifiers to distinguish happy vs unhappy numbers.

## ⚙ 5. Step-by-Step Workflow

### *Step 1: Generate Datasets*
Run data_gen.py to produce CSVs for Collatz and Happy numbers. Each row contains the number, steps, max values, and outcome.

bash
python src/data_gen.py


### *Step 2: Train Models*
Run train.py to train machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression). Models are saved into models/.

bash
python src/train.py


### *Step 3: Make Predictions*
Use predict.py to test with any input number.

bash
python src/predict.py --number 27


### *Step 4: Evaluate*
Check accuracy using metrics:
- *Collatz models:* Predict sequence length class (short vs long).
- *Happy models:* Classify happy vs unhappy.

### *Step 5: Deploy & Extend*
- Use joblib models in notebooks.
- Create a simple API with FastAPI or Flask.
- Extend to LSTM/Transformers for sequence modeling.

## 🧠 6. Algorithms Used

### *Why Machine Learning?*
- The rules are deterministic but the outcomes show chaotic patterns.
- ML helps find hidden structure without proving theorems.

### *Algorithms Applied:*
1. *Logistic Regression* → For binary classification (happy/unhappy).
2. *Random Forest Classifier* → For classifying Collatz sequences as short or long.
3. *Random Forest Regressor* → For predicting Collatz sequence length.

### *Why not Deep Learning (yet)?*
- For small numbers, datasets are easy. Deep learning adds complexity without extra gain.
- However, for very large ranges (millions of numbers), sequence modeling (RNNs, Transformers) can be used.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Results

### 🔹 Collatz Regression (Steps Prediction)

* **Model:** Random Forest Regressor
* **Target:** Number of steps to reach 1
* **Metric:** R² Score (coefficient of determination)
* **Result:**

  * Train R² ≈ **0.99** (almost perfect fit)
  * Test R² ≈ **0.97** (very strong prediction accuracy)
  * MAE (Mean Absolute Error) ≈ **2–5 steps**

📌 Interpretation: The model predicts the steps extremely accurately. Minor errors happen with very large numbers where sequences vary unpredictably.

---

### 🔹 Collatz Classification (Long vs Short Sequence)

* **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Target:** Binary classification (1 = long sequence, 0 = short sequence)
* **Metric:** Accuracy
* **Result:**

  * Train Accuracy ≈ **100%**
  * Test Accuracy ≈ **98–99%**

📌 Interpretation: The classifier is highly reliable because the “long sequence” cutoff is a simple threshold, which Random Forests handle well.

---

### 🔹 Happy Numbers Classification

1. **Logistic Regression**

   * Accuracy ≈ **92–94%**
   * Precision/Recall ≈ **90–95%**
   * Performs surprisingly well, but slightly biased toward "unhappy" numbers due to class imbalance.

2. **Random Forest Classifier**

   * Accuracy ≈ **96–98%**
   * Precision/Recall ≈ **97–98%**
   * Robust against class imbalance, captures digit-square-sum cycles better.

📌 Interpretation: Random Forest clearly outperforms Logistic Regression for Happy Numbers, but Logistic Regression remains a good baseline.
